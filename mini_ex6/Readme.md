### My program

My program consist of a lot of cicles covering the entire canvas, all having their sizes defined by the level of the amplitude of the song playing in the background. This makes the program and the expression of the of the pattern created by the circles evovle as the song becomes more intense. I'm not quiete sure if I understand the definiton of rules correctly, but I see three overall rules. First there is a rule of how the circle's size is defined. This rule is stated in line 20, where the variable "size" defines how big or small the circles should be according to the level of amplitude. Second there is a rule about how the for loop of the circle should show - The gap between the circle is set for both the x and y axis in line 21-22. Lastly there is a rule in line 44-45 of randomly shifting between the array of 3 different words. The three rules is generating a canvas with a random look to it, since the circles create different patterns as the song evolves.

### The notion of generativity 

According to the notion of generativity I amongst others think it is interesting to talk about the authorship and the level of randomness. 
In my program you can question the authorship since I see three possible perspectives on who could contribute to this. First I could be the author myself, since I made the decisions about what to code and did the coding as well. But I'm using some code that someone else came up with - I didn't come up with p5.js, so the creators of the programming language I'm using could get some credit as well. Lastly I also the artist of the song as some kind of author. I'm using the amplitude of a song, that someone else created. Since the sounds are a big part of what is generated, this artist could be part of the authorship as well. 
according to the randomness of the program, I find it a bit paradoxical to state that it is random. If you don't look at the code, the program has a random look to it, but in the code you for example see the random function of how the array is displayed. Is it random when I tell it to be random?
