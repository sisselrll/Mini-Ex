### My Program/ Game 
The game is rather simple to play - As the time goes, more and more squares will display on the canvas. Your job is then to click the squares to make them see-through. The code behind the game is more complex though, at least compared to what I have been doing before *(I must admit I did get some help as well).* The program consists of a class I called "firkant", which is where I define the proporties of my objects. The objects are the squares that gradually is displayed on the canvas. They all belong to the class since they all are defined by  the proporties I gave the class (color, size, x and y position). To actually draw the squares I have a function add, which is set to create a new square randomly from the four proporties of the class everytime 'add()' is called. 
The complexity for me in this program, was to allow one to click on a square and then the color for that clicked square would disappear. First I tried to just make the transparacy of the square's color change, but since the square was allready drawn, the new transparent square on top of the other, didn't make any sense - You couldn't see the result. I managed to overcome this challenge by drawing all of the squares again after clicking the mouse. The code checks which squares has been clicked and draws them with noFill() and the squares that haven't yet been clicked will be drawn still with the color assigned to them with fill(this.getcolor).

### The Digital Culture Context 

My initial motivation in this mini exercise was driven by comming up with a concept that allowed me to make a perspective from classes and objects to a similar phenomena in the "real world". When thinking about the meaning and function of classes and objects, the point of choosing some proporties over others cathed my attention the most. I think it is interesting and important to think about, that when you choose to define certain proporties in a class, you either intentionally or unconsciously choose to leave some out. The objects are limitied to those predefined qualities and are maybe not adequately for everyones perception of what the class and objects represents. The similar phenomena I then came up with was the expression of deviding things, persons, whatever into boxes. I think people tend to like to put a label on objects, amongst others to be able to distribute that object to a catagory we know and then mantain some kind of order, that make us cope with complexity. There is an expression in danish that says, that you can have a square view upon things ("Du har et firkantet syn p√• ting"). Figuratively speaking this would mean that your view upon things is quite black/white, simplified and not nuanced. When you put things in boxes or categories, it becomes easier for you to percieve the meaning and cope with what's different in each box. This is where I would like to draw a perspective to classes and objects in a computational matter. It would be near to impossible to consider and implement all possible proporties for every object, since it first of all would be super complex and second, it it would be hard for one person or one company even to be able to come up with and concider all imaginable qualities. It simply becomes easier and more efficient when assigning objects to classes that allready consist of predefined proporties. You just need to put your object in the class that will describe the basic qualities of the object the best, and then leave the rest out. 
My intention with the program is not to critisize the fact that we put things in boxes/classes and have a "square" view upon things, because everyone needs some order to cope with the complexity of the world. My intention with the program is rather to emphasize an awareness towards what we choose and what we leave out. We shouldn't become too comfortable with what is inside the boxes, we should also dare/choose to consider what else could have been and why it is or isn't a part of the box/class. The boxes should not limit ourselves, they should encourage us to think more about the thoughts behind the decisions.  
When you click a square in my game, you open it up and make it see-through, which symbolise that we should not always restrict ourselves to the borders of the square, you should look right though it as well :) 

Over and out.
