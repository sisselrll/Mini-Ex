### Indidividual work 
Revisit your previous mini exercises and select the most technically complex one
Draw an individual flow chart to present the program (Pay attention to: which items you select to present through a flow chart)
In the readme file:
Attach the flowchart image
You need to have a hyperlink that links to your chosen mini_ex folder.
What may be the difficulty in drawing the flow chart?

### Common group work

#### Idea 1 (Live streak)

Our program is an inspiration in between the children’s toy called a tamagotchi and  the snapchat streak phenomenon. 
In relation to the topic temporality, we got to talk about how we are drawn to social medias and spend a great amount of time on the platforms. We somehow wanted to express a critical comparison  between online social relations and offline social relations, and  with our product be able to motivate people to spend more ‘actual’ and  physical time with their friends. The intention of the program is that you quest to do a physical activity with one or more of your friends for example to drink coffee, share a meal, take a walk or be cultural. The purpose then is, that you are gaining more time to your tamagotchi - Time is valuta. If you don’t feed your Tamagotchi, we were thinking of some kind of consequence that would motivate you even more. Our idea of a consequence is that you are connected to your facebook account, and then your account would be blocked for a number of days, until you have fed your tamagotchi sufficiently with ‘time’. 

It will be a challenge to get the API from Facebook to work together with our program. We are not sure what limitations Facebook might have in their API, so it might not be possible for us to get the data that we need and it might not be possible to log in as a user. We will need to do some research and try using the actual API, to know if it is working and whether we need to figure out another solution. 

We will somehow need to figure out a way to register the interactions that the user is has with other people. We are not sure if the best solution will be to use bluetooth, location on the phone or maybe even something as old-school as infrared. How to solve this we are not sure. But we need to investigate how the same program can communicate from different devices, and if we can get the program to do this it might be possible to have a form of “registration-code” that both devices can registre at the same time and in this way be connected. For this we will also need to keep in mind how it would be possible to cheat with the different methods.
 
As a consequence of not reaching your weekly goals of real-life social interactions, we thought about blocking social media accounts. This would not ruin your life, but limit you in a lot of ways. Our program will work as almost a detox of SoMe, and therefore we want to encourage the users to go out and meet people in real life. The technical difficulty of this is how we will do this, how would we get access to the social media and is it possible in any way? In a broader context, if we were to expand the program to the full idea, we would need some sort of cooperate with these big platforms; they would need to allow us to block their users. We need to find a way of doing this, how could it be possible. There could be an alternative to it as well, that will both give incitament for users to go out, but also work as a consequence.

#### Idea 2 (Empathybot)

The program revolves around the subject of receiving and giving empathy. In this SoME culture many people has begun to feel lonely more often because we aren't present with each other to the same extent in real life. Therefore the idea is to create a Empathybot that will be with you at any time, and be aware of your emotions. The Empathybot will mimic your facial expressions and in this way give you attention until you are not lonely anymore. 

Challenges and how to solve them: 
We need to learn how to use facetracking in Javascript, and get familiar with this. We need to create an avatar that will follow you facial expressions, and therefore different parts of the avatars face has to be connected with different tracking points on the users face, so the avatar can mimic the users expressions. 


#### How is this flow chart different from the one that you had in #2 (in terms of the role of a flow chart)?

#### If you have to bring the concept of algorithms from flow charts to a wider cultural context, how would you reflect the notion of algorithms? (see if you could refer to the text and articulate your thoughts?)
