### My program 

My program consist of different variables that allows the program to use the microphone of the computer and to have the recorder save/capture a soundfile of what you record. In that way I can have the program make further use of the users audio input. I do that by having a function visualizing the frequency spectrum of the audio input. To interact with these functions I made a button that you first can click to start recording, second click stops the recorder and the third click plays the audio which is then analyzed and visulized due to the frequency spectrum. The order of the clicks on the button, is run by if and else if statements. After your third click another a "value state" variable allows you to keep recording new audio inputs. 
I randomized the fill color of the visualization of the frequency spectrum, so each time you record some audio it will show in a different color. This means that for each audio input the canvas becomes more and more colorful.

### Data Capture 

According to the notion of data capture in my program, I had some thoughts before starting to code. I was inspired of an important point in the contemporary computational world, that without humans, there is no data flow. I for example thought of the companies, that want to know as much about you to customize their sales proposals as much as possible. The more they know about you, the more targeted is their advertisement and if humans stops contributing data, their would be a totally different order online and probably offline as well. 
This made me think of a way to make a program that captures your data, saves it and uses it in the bigger picture. I somehow wanted to illustrate how a lot of data about the users, makes it more favorably for the ones who make a business out of utilizing that data.       Furthermore my program should symbolize how many tracks the user is actually leaving behind them online. 
The recorded soundfile is the data contributed from the user, which is captured saved and remembered and ready to be utilized. This is where the frequency spectrum illustrates how your data never disapears and that you have left a track behind. The random colors of the frequency spectrum, that keeps making the grey canvas more and more colorful, symbolize how the user contrubuting more data makes it more and more favorable(colorful) for the ones interested in that data.
